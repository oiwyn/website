##### Process overview of this landing page design project

### 01. Ideation
## Brainstorming

Although technically from the younger crowd, unfortunately, I can’t be considered one of the user targets of this project since I was born and raised in Indonesia during my early years and spent my college days in Singapore.

This also brings an extra unique problem to this project as my design taste was greatly influenced by my time in Singapore, making me almost unfit to design something that is aimed towards the Taiwanese people – since each person’s design taste varies greatly depending on their geographic location.

Feeling stuck, I quickly arranged a few mood boards that I can use to refer to them during my brainstorming process, aside from that I also asked my Taiwanese friend for their opinions, primarily regarding colors.

## Colors and Font

After a few design iterations, I settled on apricot-orange as the website's primary color to go with Masahiro's iconic green and the PingFang TC as the main font family that will complement well with the simple, aesthetically pleasing landing page that I'm going for.

### 02. Wireframing and Prototyping
## Blueprint

During the initial design process (wireframing), there are three main points that I focus on:
- Simple and clear layout
- Concise content with clear wording
- Attention-grabbing without being annoying

After taking into consideration of those three points, I went to draw a few sketches to get a rough idea of how the layout would look like.

## Cleaning Up

After receiving enough feedback regarding the three initial layouts, I decided to create a new layout that combined the three layouts' strong suits and adds few layout optimizations to make it clearer and more simple.

*Since the main objective of the design is only to inform user targets about Masahiro's awamori, there was only one CTA section, urging users to scroll down to know more about the product and the rest are all content that was provided by the client albeit tweaked a bit to fit the website layout better.*

### 03. Development
## Building the Magic

Why WordPress? During the first meeting with the client, we discussed few options (Wix, Squarespace, or build from scratch), but settled with WordPress instead, as that's what they are most comfortable with and way more time-efficient than building from scratch.

Aside from that, WordPress also allows me to import our custom theme file (CSS) without being restricting like other options that were discussed, and most important of all, the numbers of resources regarding WordPress that exist on the internet.

Another thing that I have done during this process was to make sure that every media files on the website have to be optimized, this means low image size without sacrificing too much of the image quality, video that loads fast without no buffering time.

### 04. Outcome

Upon few weeks after completing the project, Masahiro noticed quite an increase in their initial sales in Taiwan, although they didn't tell me how many — only that it is better than what they initially expected.
